The\nAjaces form their troops in a close phalanx, and put a stop to Hector\nand the Trojans. Several deeds of valour are performed; Meriones,\nlosing his spear in the encounter, repairs to seek another at the tent\nof Idomeneus: this occasions a conversation between those two warriors,\nwho return together to the battle. Idomeneus signalizes his courage\nabove the rest; he kills Othryoneus, Asius, and Alcathous: Deiphobus\nand Æneas march against him, and at length Idomeneus retires. Menelaus\nwounds Helenus, and kills Pisander. The Trojans are repulsed on the\nleft wing; Hector still keeps his ground against the Ajaces, till,\nbeing galled by the Locrian slingers and archers, Polydamas advises to\ncall a council of war: Hector approves of his advice, but goes first to\nrally the Trojans; upbraids Paris, rejoins Polydamas, meets Ajax again,\nand renews the attack.\n    The eight-and-twentieth day still continues.
